# Active Context: Story Protocol Integration

## Current Work Focus

- Implementing robust IPFS integration for decentralized storage
- Story Protocol integration for registering and managing AI-generated images as IP assets
- Successfully implemented image registration using `mintAndRegisterIpAssetWithPilTerms`
- Identified gap in SDK documentation regarding asset retrieval methods

## Recent Changes

- Implemented persistent IPFS storage with Helia client
- Added comprehensive IPFS configuration options
- Implemented retry mechanism and error handling for IPFS operations
- Added automatic data directory management
- Added Story Protocol service with successful image registration functionality
- Configured environment variables for all integrations

## Active Decisions

- Using filesystem-based blockstore for IPFS persistence
- Implementing gateway fallback for content verification
- Configurable pinning behavior for metadata
- Need to determine correct method for retrieving IP assets
- Current SDK version may not expose direct methods for asset retrieval

## Next Steps

1. Implement local caching system for IP asset details
2. Add comprehensive testing for IPFS operations
3. Monitor Story Protocol SDK updates for improved asset retrieval methods
4. Consider implementing Pinata or similar service integration for additional reliability
5. Add monitoring and metrics for IPFS operations

## Current Considerations

1. **IPFS Integration**: Need to implement proper IPFS storage
2. **Gas Fees**: Users will need Base Sepolia ETH for testing
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for blockchain transactions
4. **User Experience**: Making blockchain interactions user-friendly
5. **Testing**: Need comprehensive tests for blockchain interactions

## Known Issues

- Story Protocol SDK does not clearly document methods for retrieving IP assets
- Current implementation of `getAssetDetails` needs revision once correct method is identified
- IPFS operations may experience timeouts or network issues
- Need to handle IPFS node connectivity issues gracefully
