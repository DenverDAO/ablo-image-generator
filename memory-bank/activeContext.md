# Active Context: Story Protocol Integration

## Current Work Focus

- Implementing robust IPFS integration with Pinata for reliable storage
- Story Protocol integration for registering and managing AI-generated images as IP assets
- Successfully implemented image registration using `mintAndRegisterIpAssetWithPilTerms`
- Implemented asset retrieval using Story Protocol's HTTP API
- Added Pinata integration for reliable content pinning

## Recent Changes

- Implemented persistent IPFS storage with Helia client
- Added Pinata service for reliable pinning
- Added comprehensive IPFS configuration options
- Implemented retry mechanism and error handling for IPFS operations
- Added automatic data directory management
- Added Story Protocol service with successful image registration functionality
- Implemented asset retrieval using HTTP API
- Configured environment variables for all integrations

## Active Decisions

- Using filesystem-based blockstore for IPFS persistence
- Using Pinata for reliable content pinning
- Implementing gateway fallback for content verification
- Configurable pinning behavior for metadata
- Using Story Protocol HTTP API for asset retrieval
- Current SDK version may not expose direct methods for asset retrieval

## Next Steps

1. Implement local caching system for IP asset details
2. Add comprehensive testing for IPFS operations
3. Monitor Story Protocol SDK updates for improved asset retrieval methods
4. Add monitoring and metrics for IPFS operations
5. Implement batch operations for content pinning
6. Add content verification mechanisms

## Current Considerations

1. **IPFS Integration**: Need to implement proper IPFS storage
2. **Gas Fees**: Users will need Base Sepolia ETH for testing
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for blockchain transactions
4. **User Experience**: Making blockchain interactions user-friendly
5. **Testing**: Need comprehensive tests for blockchain interactions

## Known Issues

- Story Protocol SDK does not clearly document methods for retrieving IP assets
- IPFS operations may experience timeouts or network issues
- Need to handle IPFS node connectivity issues gracefully
- Need to implement proper error handling for Pinata API rate limits
