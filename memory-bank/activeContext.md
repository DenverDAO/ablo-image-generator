# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Fixed TypeScript errors in Story Protocol integration
- Improved error handling in IPFS and Pinata services
- Enhanced type safety across the backend services

## Recent Changes

- Updated Story Protocol service to use correct SDK methods and types
- Fixed IPFS service error handling and content type management
- Corrected Pinata service configuration import
- Improved image controller to properly handle async service instances
- Enhanced error handling with proper TypeScript types

## Next Steps

- Test the complete image generation and NFT minting flow
- Add comprehensive error handling for missing API keys
- Implement frontend error handling for failed API calls
- Add retry mechanisms for blockchain transactions

## Active Decisions

- Using Story Protocol's `mintAndRegisterIp` method for NFT minting
- Implementing proper TypeScript error handling across all services
- Using both local IPFS node and Pinata for redundancy
- Following singleton pattern for service instances

## Current Considerations

- Need to ensure proper error handling for all external service calls
- Consider implementing rate limiting for API calls
- May need to add transaction monitoring for NFT minting
- Consider adding more detailed logging for debugging

## Current Work Focus

- Implementing robust IPFS integration with Pinata for reliable storage
- Story Protocol integration for registering and managing AI-generated images as IP assets
- Successfully implemented image registration using `mintAndRegisterIpAssetWithPilTerms`
- Implemented asset retrieval using Story Protocol's HTTP API
- Added Pinata integration for reliable content pinning

## Active Decisions

- Using filesystem-based blockstore for IPFS persistence
- Using Pinata for reliable content pinning
- Implementing gateway fallback for content verification
- Configurable pinning behavior for metadata
- Using Story Protocol HTTP API for asset retrieval
- Current SDK version may not expose direct methods for asset retrieval

## Known Issues

- Story Protocol SDK does not clearly document methods for retrieving IP assets
- IPFS operations may experience timeouts or network issues
- Need to handle IPFS node connectivity issues gracefully
- Need to implement proper error handling for Pinata API rate limits
