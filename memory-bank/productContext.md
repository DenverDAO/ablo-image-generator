# Product Context: Ablo Image Generator

## Why This Project Exists

The Ablo Image Generator addresses several key needs in the AI-generated content space:

1. **Creation Access**: Provides an accessible interface for users to create AI-generated images without requiring deep technical knowledge of AI models.

2. **IP Protection Gap**: As AI-generated content becomes more prevalent, there's a growing need to establish clear ownership and attribution. Currently, most AI image generators lack robust mechanisms for intellectual property protection.

3. **Blockchain Utility**: Leverages blockchain technology for practical use cases beyond speculation, showing how Web3 can solve real problems in the creative economy.

4. **Creator Empowerment**: Gives creators more control over their AI-generated content and potential monetization opportunities.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Ownership Ambiguity**: AI-generated content often exists in a legal gray area regarding ownership. By integrating with Story Protocol, Ablo clearly establishes provenance and ownership records on the blockchain.

2. **Attribution Challenges**: Proper attribution for AI-generated content is difficult to maintain as images spread across the internet. Blockchain registration creates a permanent, verifiable record of creation and attribution.

3. **Monetization Barriers**: Without clear ownership mechanisms, monetizing AI-generated content can be challenging. The Story Protocol integration lays groundwork for future licensing and royalty features.

4. **Trust Issues**: Users may be hesitant to use AI-generated content commercially without certainty about ownership rights. Blockchain verification provides this assurance.

## How It Should Work

From the user's perspective, the application should:

1. Provide a simple, intuitive interface for generating images through text prompts
2. Offer a seamless option to register generated images as IP Assets
3. Require minimal blockchain knowledge from users
4. Handle technical complexities behind the scenes
5. Provide clear feedback about the registration status
6. Allow users to view and manage their registered IP Assets
7. Educate users about the benefits of IP registration
